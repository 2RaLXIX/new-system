To check which version of MySQL is installed on your Linux server, you can use the following command:

```sh
mysql --version
```

or

```sh
mysql -V
```

This should output the version of MySQL that is currently installed.

### Exporting the Database

To export all databases, you can use the `mysqldump` command. Hereâ€™s how you can create a dump file of all databases:

```sh
mysqldump -u root -p --all-databases > all_databases.sql
```

You will be prompted to enter the MySQL root password.

### Importing the Database on the New Server

1. **Transfer the dump file to the new server**: You can use `scp` (secure copy) to transfer the dump file to the new server. Replace `user` and `new_server_ip` with the appropriate values.

    ```sh
    scp all_databases.sql user@new_server_ip:/path/to/destination
    ```

2. **Import the dump file**: Once the dump file is on the new server, you can import it into MySQL:

    ```sh
    mysql -u root -p < /path/to/destination/all_databases.sql
    ```

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Check MySQL Version on the Source Server**:

    ```sh
    mysql --version
    ```

2. **Export the Databases**:

    ```sh
    mysqldump -u root -p --all-databases > all_databases.sql
    ```

3. **Transfer the Dump File to the New Server**:

    ```sh
    scp all_databases.sql user@new_server_ip:/path/to/destination
    ```

4. **Log in to the New Server**:

    ```sh
    ssh user@new_server_ip
    ```

5. **Import the Dump File on the New Server**:

    ```sh
    mysql -u root -p < /path/to/destination/all_databases.sql
    ```

### Additional Tips

- Make sure that the MySQL service is running on both servers before you start the export and import process.
- Ensure that you have sufficient disk space on both the source and destination servers to handle the database dump file.
- Verify that the MySQL user you are using has the necessary permissions to export and import the databases.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully migrate all your MySQL databases from one Linux server to another. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
